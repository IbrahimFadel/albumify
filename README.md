# albumify
An extremely simple app that displays Spotify's current song's album art, title, and progress

![Example](images/example.png)

After switching to Spotify, i noticed they don't have a way to only see the album art like Itunes. This runs along side Spotify and shows all that stuff.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/IbrahimFadel/albumify
cd albumify
```

Go to the [Spotify Developer Console](https://developer.spotify.com/console/) and get credentials. Put them into ```albumify.py```

```
sudo make install
```

## Usage

While a spotify song is playing, just run

```
albumify
```

This will open up the window
